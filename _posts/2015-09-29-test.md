I am in the process of setting up a github.io page for my personal projects. Originally it was heavily pased on [Tom Preston-Werner's page](http://tom.preston-werner.com/). This post is a test.

Then I tried using the [Hyde theme](http://hyde.getpoole.com/). Experimenting with Jekyll and all that.

New theme: [Flex](http://the-development.github.io/flex/)
