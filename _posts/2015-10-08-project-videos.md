Here are some videos of a couple of robotics projects I have worked on:

  * [Motion Planning for Probabilistic Representations of Robot Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5WK_5WZfmk)
  * [CoSTAR: Collaborative System for Task Automation and Recognition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO1xpLy3VGQ)
  * [Robot Learning from Demonstration: From Mimicking to Emulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC-HoL6N7rI)

Keep following for some more information on these things and how they work.
