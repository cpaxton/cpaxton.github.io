My team and I are finalists for the KUKA innovation award. This is a cool competition run by [KUKA Robotics](http://www.kuka-ag.de/en/start.htm) where they provide finalists with a robot and fly them out to a competition at [Hannover Messe](http://www.hannovermesse.de/home).

Part of the course involves using the KUKA Sunrise API to build a short program to pick up a gear, show it off, and then put it back down in a different slot using impedance control.

The [LBR iiwa](http://www.kuka-lbr-iiwa.com/) is a very nice robot, and we are excited to have a new one to work with.
