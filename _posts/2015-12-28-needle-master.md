I put the source of my Needle Master android game on GitHub for the first time today, so that other people can take a look and possibly use it or modify it themselves.

The goals of Needle Master were to:
  - Have a variety of levels with repeated structure
  - Incorporate complex obstacles and hazards to avoid
  - Allow researchers to record gameplay for analysis and learning

Take a look at the code [here](https://github.com/cpaxton/needlemaster) or download from the Google Play store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.jhu.lcsr.needlemaster).
