title: Improving Robot Teleoperation with ASCENT
---

Happy new years! To start off 2016 right, I am going to post a couple more videos of work I am involved in.

One of the projects I have been involved in is developing an environment for testing a robotic structure assembly task. Teleoperation of robots under high-latency conditions is very difficult, but may be important for a range of applications. For example, we may want to teleoperate a robot in orbit from the Earth performing some complicated task like satellite repair. ASCENT takes a "do what I intend, not what I do" approach to teleoperation, interpreting user commands in order to dispatch high-level commands to a remote agent.

User performing structure assembly under high latency conditions with no augmenter at all:

And now with the ASCENT augmenter:
