We just recieved one of the new Intel R200 depth sensors.

It came in a nice little box like this. I still haven't had a chance to test it out; it's supported on Windows, Android, and there is code for ROS integration available [as well](https://github.com/PercATI/RealSense_ROS).

The big thing that struck me about it so far, though: it's way smaller than I was expecting. It actually compares favorably to the Primesense Carmine we have been using, as opposed to the bulky Kinect for Xbox One.
