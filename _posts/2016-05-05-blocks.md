title: SmartMove and Collaborative Assembly
---

One of the new capabilities we developed was the __SmartMove__. SmartMoves choose a set of possible parent frames based on predicates generated by our knowledge architecture, [Predicator](https://github.com/cpaxton/predicator). We usually set things up to perform SmartMoves for objects that were on one side or another of a particular marker:

In particular we ran a demo at Hannover Messe that had us manipulating sets of blocks. The robot would pick up a block from the right side of the table while a human user assembled a structure on the right side. More complex tasks are possible, where the robot demonstrates more autonomy, but we thought this made for a particularly compelling example of human-machine collaboration. In particular, people from the crowd loved being able to put their hand out and have the robot give them a block.

This is the only video of me performing the task:

I was usually busy explaining things or making sure things were running smoothly. The robot was a lot of fun to work with, though, and I think the SmartMove capability we added made programming it that little bit more natural and powerful.
