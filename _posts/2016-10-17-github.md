title: Getting started with Git
---

It has come to my attention that a lot of our new and incoming students have not really used Git before. Git's an incredibly useful tool for software engineering; it's particularly important for working on group projects.

There are a couple reasons for this:
  - It tracks user contributions and file history, making it easier to figure out when bugs were introduced
  - It allows us to easily maintain different versions of a project with features that are currently in development
  - It makes it easy to combine different subsets of our code.

Let's get started. On Ubuntu you can install git like so:

```
sudo apt-get install git
```

On Windows, the process is barely more complicated. Download [Git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and add it to your system path. Quick windows command line refresher: to bring up the command prompt, press windows+R, then type "cmd" and press enter. Everything else will be the same after this.

Now, there are a couple million guides that are a Google search away if you want to learn how to use Git with a new repository (see, for example, [this one](https://www.sitepoint.com/git-for-beginners/) or [this one](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository/) or [all these](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github/). In this example, I'm going to talk about how to specifically start contributing to one of my projects as an example for how to get things running.

What follows is a brief, high-level guide to how to get started using Git. This is not meant to be comprehensive, and those well-acquainted with git may not love how I use some of these terms. The point here is to get the high-level concepts across for people who have not yet dug into all the details.

### Set Up Your Account

You'll need to create an account on GitHub or whatever other site you are using. For GitHub, create an SSH key as per the instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/).

For GitLab (which we use internally at JHU), the [instructions are similar](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/create-your-ssh-keys.html).

### Clone The Project

We use `git clone` to download the project and its history. To clone [CoSTAR](https://github.com/cpaxton/costar_stack), for example:

```
git clone git@github.com:cpaxton/costar_stack.git
```

Now, CoSTAR is a ROS project, which means you clone it into your Catkin workspace. For something else, like [this java game](https://www.github.com/cpaxton/threadtheneedle.git), you can clone it wherever seems appropriate. For MATLAB code like [this](https://www.github.com/cpaxton/grid_matlab.git), you would normally clone it into your MATLAB workspace, for example.

### Branches

Git lets us track code in different branches. For example, if I `cd costar_stack`, then I can run `git branch`:

```
chris@blunderbuss:~/catkin_ws/src/costar_stack$ git branch
  add-save-frame
  devel
* master
  pcl_1.7.2_required
```

This means I am currently on branch master.

When you are starting out, you probably want to create your own branch for whatever feature you will be working on. For example, if I am adding support for the Barrett WAM arm to CoSTAR, I might do this:

```
git checkout -b barrett-wam
```

This creates a new branch called `barret-wam` and moves me into that branch.

In the future, we can switch between branches with `git checkout`:

```
git checkout master
git checkout barrett-wam
```

### Making Changes and Pushing

Let's say I add a new file: `FILE.md`. In this case, I use the `git add` command:

```
git add FILE.md
```

This tells Git it should add this file to the set of files it's currently tracking.

Now I want to _commit_ this change. This actually adds it to my history.

```
git commit -a
```

A message will pop up to tell you to enter a message. Try to keep these messages short and sweet, and keep your commits atomic. What that means is that I only change essentially one thing at a time.

We're not done! Now I've added this file to my local history, but I still need to share with others. To do that, I _push_:

```
git push origin barret-wam
```

Substitute `barret-wam` with whatever your branch is called.

### Stay Up To Date

Use the `git fetch` command to keep your local information up to date. Use `git pull` to download changes others have made.

Hopefully this helps you get started.
