So we set up an initial CoSTAR release. The installation instructions available on [Github](https://github.com/cpaxton/costar_stack/) should all work and be fairly easy to follow.

At this point, we have a working version of the system without many of the weird UI bugs we used to have. These included, in prior versions:
  - UI elements detaching
  - Massive memory leaks
  - Buttons that did not do what people expected.

In addition, Felix implemented some functionality that makes the robot move a little more smoothly and naturally when being servoed to arbitrary positions.
