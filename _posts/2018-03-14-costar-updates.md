The [newest version of CoSTAR](https://github.com/cpaxton/costar_stack/releases/tag/v1.3.2) adds a few features I have meant to put in for a while:
  - a better smartmove for placing objects in preset positions, the SmartPlace
  - a system for specifying constraints on generated goals when commanding SmartMoves
  - support for joint-space movement goals, planned or otherwise

These are not yet integrated into the UI, but will be showed off in our as-of-yet unreleased [CoSTAR-Plan package](https://cpaxton.github.io/costar_plan/)
