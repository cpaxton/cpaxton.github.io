title: About Me
---

I am a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, studying robotics and human/robot interaction.

In particular, I am interested in ways we can allow non-expert users to give robots the knowledge they need to be able to plan and adapt to new environments. Effectively, I am interested in making robots into true co-workers that can do the parts of a task that are difficult for humans.

## Education

I did my undergraduate work at University of Maryland, College Park, where I got a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Neuroscience.
