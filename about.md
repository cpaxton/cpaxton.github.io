I am a graduate student at Johns Hopkins University, studying robotics and human/robot interaction.

In particular, I am interested in ways we can allow non-expert users to give robots the knowledge they need to be able to plan and adapt to new environments. Effectively, I am interested in making robots into true co-workers that can do the parts of a task that are difficult for humans.

My work focuses on integrating symbolic task planning with learning from expert demonstrations. The goal is to give robots "common sense" and let them intelligently interact with their environments. The most recent incarnation of this project is our new work on creating "robots with imagination" -- letting robots learn about the consequences their actions will have for the world, and being able to picture and plan based on these imagined actions.

As of Spring 2016, one of my major projects was working on the JHU team for the KUKA Innovation Award competition. I led our successful entry into the KUKA innovation award competition. Our entry integrated UI, vision, planning, and some simple reasoning capabilities to build a powerful product that allowed us to perform a variety of tasks.

## Education

As of Spring 2018, I successfully defended my PhD in Computer Science at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. My PhD thesis is titled "Creating Task Plans for Collaborative Robots," and it covers both our CoSTAR system and the novel algorithms we have created for creating robots that can use expert knowledge to plan.

I did my undergraduate work at University of Maryland, College Park, where I got a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Neuroscience, where I graduated with University honors as a part of their Gemstone program for young researchers.
