## About

This was created by me, [Chris Paxton](/about/index.html), using [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) essentially exclusively.

The idea was to work through an example with my friend [Kel](https://www.kel.ai/) about how effective AI was at code generation. We discussed different features to add to the game; after ~an hour or so of prompting and re-prompting, this was the result.

No code was written manually! Everything, including the HTML templates, was generated by the free tier of perplexity, as of Oct. 9, 2024.
