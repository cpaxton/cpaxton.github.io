  text: "You stand at the threshold of the forgotten past, where the remnants of time\
    \ whisper secrets of ages gone by. The ground beneath your feet crumbles softly,\
    \ revealing layers of dust and debris that once hid tales of glory and decay.\
    \ Shadows stretch out from the walls, drawn by the ethereal light filtering through\
    \ the broken windows above. Here, the air is heavy with the scent of sulfur and\
    \ old parchment, mingling with the faint aroma of something slightly sweet and\
    \ strange. \n\nAround you, the castle looms ominously, its structures leaning\
    \ precariously, as though they too are on the verge of collapse. The air is thick\
    \ with the lingering echoes of laughter, sorrow, and perhaps, the whispers of\
    \ those who have come before. The silence is both comforting and foreboding, inviting\
    \ you to explore the depths of this forgotten place."
