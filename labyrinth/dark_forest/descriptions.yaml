  text: "You find yourself standing at the edge of a dark, misty forest, the boundary\
    \ between the known world and the unknown shrouded in perpetual twilight. The\
    \ air is thick with the scent of damp earth and the distant hum of unseen creatures.\
    \ The ground is covered in a carpet of decaying leaves, and the sky is hidden\
    \ behind a veil of dense foliage. \n\nFrom where you stand, two paths diverge:\
    \ one to the north, leading deeper into the forest, and another to the east, where\
    \ the trees seem to thin slightly. Each path is lined with gnarled, ancient trees\
    \ whose roots seem to intertwine with the earth like living tendrils. The path\
    \ to the north feels more inviting, though both paths are equally treacherous\
    \ under the weight of the creeping darkness. \n\nYou feel a strange pull towards\
    \ the north, as if something beckons you forward, but also a warning, a sense\
    \ that the forest holds secrets best left unexplored. Your heart races, and your\
    \ breath quickens as you prepare to venture further into this eerie, enchanted\
    \ land."
