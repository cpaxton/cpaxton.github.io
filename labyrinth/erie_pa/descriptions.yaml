  text: You find yourself standing in a quaint, sun-dappled courtyard, bordered by
    towering elms that seem to whisper secrets to one another. The cobblestone path
    leads to two possible entrances, both equally inviting yet slightly ominous. On
    one side, a stone arch beckons you into the next realm with its hint of mystery.
    On the other, a gnarled old tree offers a cozy, shadowy hideaway. Each pathway
    is lined with lush greenery, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming
    wildflowers. A gentle breeze whispers through the leaves, creating a symphony
    that lulls you into a dreamlike state. You can’t help but wonder what secrets
    lie behind each door.
