  text: The threshold of the dark, twisting labyrinth of Minos is a yawning chasm,
    its edges jagged and gnarled as they pierce the gloom. Here, the ground slopes
    sharply downward, leading into the abyss, while above, the ceiling hangs perilously
    close, its surface marred by ancient, calcified vines that twist and turn like
    the very threads of fate itself. You stand at the edge, where the darkness seems
    to whisper secrets in a voice both harsh and haunting, urging you forward with
    promises of both danger and reward. The air here is heavy and oppressive, filled
    with the scent of decay and the faint echo of footsteps on unseen stones. The
    only illumination comes from the flickering shadows that dance across the walls,
    casting eerie patterns upon the stone.
