## Ok, but what is it?

This is the Infinite Quiz Machine, a project by me, [Chris Paxton](/about/index.html).

The quizzes are generated by AI, using [Virgil](https://github.com/cpaxton/virgil), my library for exploring AI-based storytelling.

Specifically, I used [Gemma 2b](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b/tree/main) to generate the text and image prompts, and illustrated the questions and results with [Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/en/index).

## But why?

If you're an internet dweller of a certain age, you remember constant, bizarre Buzzfeed quizzes that never quite made sense but appeared all over Facebook, Instagram, whatever. A friend of mine was bringing it back, so to speak -- sharing similar weird quizzes on Discord -- and it made me think that this was the sort of thing AI could do really well, in a way that would be surprising, fun, and a little bit uncanny.

So, we come to AI. The term "slop" is thrown around a lot for AI these days, and [the role of AI in the arts](https://itcanthink.substack.com/p/off-topic-what-role-for-ai-in-the) is something that I have thought about a lot. I think it *does* have a roll, and while I don't consider the quizes generated by the Infinite Quiz Machine to be "art" per se, I do think the Machine itself sort of is.

The quizzes are all designed to be a bit weird and uncanny. They're not what *people* might make, and that's what makes it so fun - they're like quizzes made by an alien who just barely understands human language and culture.

I think it's deeply fun and have gotten a ton of enjoyment out of running through endless, bizarre, horribly illustrated personality tests -- that somehow still work a lot of the time!

I hope you enjoy them too. If you have any feedback, or want to see more, please let me know!
