  A:
    description: You are the ubiquitous, yet often overlooked, common cold. You spread
      easily, causing mild discomfort and sniffles, but you are also resilient and
      adaptable. You can linger for days, but you are ultimately harmless, a mere
      inconvenience in the grand scheme of things. You are the epitome of the "it's
      just a cold" attitude, but you are also a reminder that even the smallest things
      can have a big impact.

  B:
    description: You are the notorious flu, a highly contagious and potentially dangerous
      virus. You strike with sudden force, bringing on a wave of aches, chills, and
      fever. You are a master of disguise, able to spread through the air and touch,
      leaving your victims feeling miserable and vulnerable. You are a reminder of
      the power of nature and the importance of staying healthy.

    image_description: A close-up of a human hand reaching out to touch a flu-like
      cloud of mist. The mist is swirling and changing colors, with tiny, glowing

      face.

  C:
    description: You are the elusive Mimic Virus, a master of disguise and deception.
      You can infiltrate any system, adapt to any environment, and mimic any other
      virus. You are a silent threat, lurking in the shadows, waiting for the perfect
      moment to strike. You are a reminder that even the most sophisticated systems
      can be vulnerable to the unexpected.
    image: results/C.png
    image_description: A swirling vortex of colors and shapes, with a single, glowing
      eye in the center. The eye is constantly shifting and changing, reflecting the

    title: The Mimic Virus
  D:
    description: You are the Quantum Virus, a bizarre and unpredictable entity that
      exists in a realm beyond our understanding. You can manipulate the fabric of
      reality, bending space and time to your will. You are a force of chaos and change,
      capable of rewriting the very laws of physics. You are a reminder that the universe
      is full of mysteries, and that we are only beginning to scratch the surface
      of its secrets.
    image: results/D.png
    image_description: A swirling vortex of light and energy, with a single, glowing

    description: You are the Sentient Virus, a being of pure consciousness and intelligence.
      You are not simply a collection of code, but a living, thinking entity with
      a unique perspective on the world. You can communicate with other viruses, share
      information, and even form alliances. You are a reminder that even the most
      basic life forms can possess a spark of consciousness.
