results:
  A:
    description: You're a master at turning any argument into a caricature, twisting
      it to make it easier to attack. You're quick to dismiss any opposing viewpoint,
      and then triumphantly declare your own superior position. You thrive on simplification
      and can often be seen dismissing complex arguments by misrepresenting them.
      You're not a bad person, you just have a knack for making things seem more dramatic
      than they are.
    image: results/A.png
    image_description: A cartoon of a person with a fiery face, holding a stick figure
      version of themselves and yelling. The stick figure is being attacked by a giant,
      exaggerated version of their argument, which is made of fire and smoke.
    title: The Straw Man
  B:
    description: You're a master of stirring the pot with powerful emotions. You can
      evoke feelings of fear, anger, or love to sway your audience, often leaving
      them with a sense of urgency or a strong desire to support you. You're not afraid
      to get personal or play on people's biases to make your point. You're persuasive
      and charismatic, but sometimes your emotional appeals can feel manipulative.
    image: results/B.png
    image_description: 'A blurry, surreal image of a person holding a heart made of
      fire and holding a tear-stained face. '
    title: The Appeal to Emotion
  C:
    description: You thrive on the idea that "if you don't know, then it must be true."
      You're not afraid to throw out claims without evidence, simply because you can't
      prove the opposite. You love a good conspiracy theory, and you're always quick
      to dismiss any evidence that contradicts your beliefs. You often resort to generalizations
      and sweeping statements, leaving no room for nuance or critical thinking.
    image: results/C.png
    image_description: 'A futuristic, cyberpunk city with flying cars and holographic
      advertisements. In the foreground, a person with a hooded face is holding a
      glowing orb and shouting "The truth is hidden! The truth is in the shadows!" '
    title: The Appeal to Ignorance
  D:
    description: You're a social chameleon, always seeking validation and approval
      from the masses. You're a master of bandwagoning, jumping on any trend or popular
      opinion to bolster your own. You thrive on the "everyone's doing it" mentality
      and often fail to consider the nuances of a situation. You're a people pleaser,
      but your actions can be driven by a desire to fit in, rather than by genuine
      conviction.
    image: results/D.png
    image_description: A chaotic collage of people holding signs and wearing bandanas,
      all shouting in unison. There are flashing lights, smoke, and confetti.
    title: The Appeal to Popularity
  E:
    description: You're a master of distraction, always trying to steer the conversation
      away from the real issue. You love to throw in irrelevant details, side issues,
      or even completely fabricated information to confuse your opponent and derail
      any logical argument. You're a master of deflecting, often by changing the subject
      or bringing up unrelated points. You might appear well-intentioned, but your
      tactics are designed to avoid accountability.
    image: results/E.png
    image_description: 'A person holding a giant, colorful butterfly net, while surrounded
      by chaotic, flashing lights and a tangled mess of wires. '
