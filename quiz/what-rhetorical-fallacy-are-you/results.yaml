A:
  description: You're a master at turning any argument into a caricature, twisting
    it to make it easier to attack. You're quick to dismiss any opposing viewpoint,
    and then triumphantly declare your own superior position. You thrive on simplification
    and can often be seen dismissing complex arguments by misrepresenting them. You're
    not a bad person, you just have a knack for making things seem more dramatic than
    they are.

    themselves and yelling. The stick figure is being attacked by a giant, exaggerated
    version of their argument, which is made of fire and smoke.

B:
  description: You're a master of stirring the pot with powerful emotions. You can
    evoke feelings of fear, anger, or love to sway your audience, often leaving them
    with a sense of urgency or a strong desire to support you. You're not afraid to
    get personal or play on people's biases to make your point. You're persuasive
    and charismatic, but sometimes your emotional appeals can feel manipulative.

C:
  description: You thrive on the idea that "if you don't know, then it must be true."
    You're not afraid to throw out claims without evidence, simply because you can't
    prove the opposite. You love a good conspiracy theory, and you're always quick
    to dismiss any evidence that contradicts your beliefs. You often resort to generalizations
    and sweeping statements, leaving no room for nuance or critical thinking.

D:
  description: You're a social chameleon, always seeking validation and approval from
    the masses. You're a master of bandwagoning, jumping on any trend or popular opinion
    to bolster your own. You thrive on the "everyone's doing it" mentality and often
    fail to consider the nuances of a situation. You're a people pleaser, but your
    actions can be driven by a desire to fit in, rather than by genuine conviction.

E:
  description: You're a master of distraction, always trying to steer the conversation
    away from the real issue. You love to throw in irrelevant details, side issues,
    or even completely fabricated information to confuse your opponent and derail
    any logical argument. You're a master of deflecting, often by changing the subject
    or bringing up unrelated points. You might appear well-intentioned, but your tactics
    are designed to avoid accountability.
