  A:
    description: You are the embodiment of cosmic dread, a being of unimaginable power
      and ancient knowledge. You are the source of all nightmares, the whisper in
      the dark, the unseen hand that guides the tides of fate. You are the ultimate
      unknowable, the apex predator of existence, and your presence is a constant
      reminder of the vast, indifferent universe. You are the ultimate cosmic horror,
      and you are devoted to its unknowable will.
    image: results/A.png
    image_description: 'A swirling vortex of colors and shapes, with a single, impossibly
      large eye staring out from the center. The eye is filled with a deep, black
      void, and its gaze seems to pierce the very fabric of reality. The vortex is
      surrounded by a halo of shimmering, ethereal light, and the colors shift and
      change constantly, creating a sense of unease and disorientation. '
    title: The Great Old One
  B:
    description: You are a collective consciousness, a single entity composed of countless
      minds. You are the embodiment of unity and purpose, a hive mind that functions
      as one. You are the ultimate predator, a force of nature that consumes and adapts,
      always seeking to expand and dominate. You are the ultimate embodiment of the
      collective, and your will is absolute.
    image: results/B.png
    image_description: 'A vast, sprawling network of interconnected nodes, each pulsing
      with a faint, ethereal light. The nodes are constantly shifting and changing,
      forming intricate patterns and shapes that seem to defy logic and reason. The
      network is filled with a sense of constant movement and energy, and the nodes
      seem to be communicating with each other in a language that is both beautiful
      and terrifying. '
    title: The Hive Mind
  C:
    description: You are a creature of pure nightmare, a being that feeds on the dreams
      of mortals. You are the embodiment of the subconscious, the dark side of the
      mind. You are the ultimate destroyer of hope, the harbinger of despair. You
      are the ultimate predator of the mind, and your presence is a constant reminder
      of the fragility of reality.
    image: results/C.png
    image_description: 'A swirling vortex of darkness and shadows, with tendrils of
      smoke and mist reaching out from the center. The vortex is filled with distorted
      images of faces and landscapes, and the shadows seem to writhe and twist in
      a way that is both beautiful and terrifying. The vortex is surrounded by a halo
      of shimmering, ethereal light, and the colors shift and change constantly, creating
      a sense of unease and disorientation. '
    title: The Dream Eater
  D:
    description: You are a being of pure chaos, a force of nature that defies all
      understanding. You are the embodiment of the void, the ultimate unknown. You
      are the ultimate destroyer of all things, the harbinger of oblivion. You are
      the ultimate unknowable, and your presence is a constant reminder of the vast,
      indifferent universe.
    image: results/D.png
    image_description: 'A swirling vortex of pure nothingness, with no discernible
      form or shape. The vortex is filled with a sense of utter emptiness, and the
      colors are a deep, inky black. The vortex seems to be expanding and contracting,
      creating a sense of both awe and terror. '
    title: The Unnameable
  E:
    description: You are a being of pure illusion, a creature that can perfectly mimic
      any form or object. You are the embodiment of deception, the ultimate trickster.
      You are the ultimate predator of the senses, and your presence is a constant
      reminder of the fragility of reality. You are the ultimate chameleon, and your
      form is ever-changing.
    image: results/E.png
    image_description: 'A shifting, ever-changing landscape of impossible geometry
      and impossible forms. The landscape is constantly morphing and changing, with
