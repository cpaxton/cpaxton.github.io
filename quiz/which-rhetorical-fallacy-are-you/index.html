  A:
    description: You're the life of the party, the one everyone gravitates towards.
      You thrive on the energy of the crowd, and you're always eager to share your
      opinions, even if they're not always the most well-reasoned. You're a natural
      leader, and you're not afraid to speak your mind, even if it means going against
      the grain. Your strength lies in your ability to connect with people and inspire
      them to follow you. However, you can sometimes be swayed by the opinions of
      others, and you may not always be able to think for yourself.

    image_description: 'A group of people cheering and clapping, with a spotlight
      shining on a charismatic individual in the center. The individual is smiling
      and waving, and they are surrounded by a sea of faces. '
    title: Appeal to Popularity
  B:
    description: You're a master of stirring the pot, and you're not afraid to get
      people riled up. You're passionate about your beliefs, and you're not afraid
      to let people know how you feel. You can be quite persuasive, and you're always
      ready to defend your position, even if it means resorting to emotional appeals.
      Your strength lies in your ability to connect with people on a deep level, and
      you're always ready to fight for what you believe in. However, you can sometimes
      be too emotional, and you may not always be able to think clearly under pressure.
    image: results/B.png
    image_description: 'A person standing in front of a roaring fire, their eyes filled
      with intensity and determination. They are holding a burning torch aloft, and
      their expression is one of fierce passion. '
    title: Appeal to Emotion
  C:
    description: You're a master of twisting arguments to make them easier to attack.
      You love to create a caricature of your opponent's position, exaggerating their
      claims and making them seem ridiculous. You're always ready to jump on any perceived
      weakness, and you're not afraid to use it against your opponent. Your strength
      lies in your ability to create a sense of conflict, and you're always ready
      to fight for your side. However, you can sometimes be too quick to attack, and
      you may not always be able to see the bigger picture.
    image: results/C.png
    image_description: 'A cartoonish depiction of a person with a distorted face and
      exaggerated features, holding a crumpled piece of paper with a distorted argument
      written on it. '
    title: Straw Man
  D:
    description: You're a master of attacking the person, rather than the argument.
      You're quick to point out flaws in your opponent's character, and you're not
      afraid to use personal attacks to discredit them. You're always ready to throw
      mud at your opponent, and you're not afraid to use it to win an argument. Your
      strength lies in your ability to make people feel uncomfortable, and you're
      always ready to fight dirty. However, you can sometimes be too focused on personal
      attacks, and you may not always be able to make a strong case for your own position.
    image: results/D.png
    image_description: 'A person with a scowling face and a clenched fist, standing
      in front of a large, menacing shadow. '
    title: Ad Hominem
  E:
    description: You're a master of the "it's just not proven" argument. You love
      to point out that something hasn't been proven, and you're not afraid to use
      that as a reason to dismiss it. You're always ready to throw up your hands and
      say "we don't know" when faced with a difficult question. Your strength lies
      in your ability to avoid responsibility, and you're always ready to avoid a
      difficult conversation. However, you can sometimes be too quick to dismiss things
      without evidence, and you may not always be able to think critically.
